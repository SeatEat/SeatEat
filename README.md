SeatEat is an app that provides estimation of crowdedness at KTHâ€™s different chapter halls. It fetches data about different programmes' schedules to estimate the number of people at a time. KTH students can view the current crowdedness of their respective chapter halls as well as daily and weekly. It is also possible to check in to a chapter hall. Other students can see where and when you checked in as well as what you are doing. 

With SeatEat you'll never have to step unprepared into a crowded hall again.

## Current features

* Fetches schedules for respective chapter halls at KTH from the <a href='https://www.kth.se/en/api/anvand-data-fran-kth-1.57059'>KTH API</a>.
* Displays the crowdedness estimation in three different views; current, daily and weekly.
* Allows for check in at a chapter hall. Checkout data is stored in a firebase db. User information is saved in local storage to allow the user to check out when returning to the website.

## Planned features

* Allow users to change the average student amount of each programme and class.

## Structure
The app is built with react and redux. The store is provided with react-redux which is also used to map state and dispatch to components. The app also uses react-router-dom for routing. It is written using TypeScript. Check in data is stored using firebase's firestore.

# Start development
The current site is now using express as server backend. Do the following to begin development:

1. Go to the root folder and type `node server` This starts the express app on port 5000.
2. Go to the client folder and type `npm start`. This starts the the front-end server on port 3000. This is the one that should be open in the browser.
3. Follow the instruction from the following [repository](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/SeatEat/SeatEat-Credentials).

# Error
If you get an error running from a "clean" (You have not changed any code) master branch, it is often because you have not installed the latest packages. Go to the **client** folder and run `npm install`. Then restart the "Start development part again".
