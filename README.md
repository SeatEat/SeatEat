# Start development
The current site is now using express as server backend. Do the following to begin development:

1. Go to the root folder and type `node server` This starts the express app on port 5000.
2. Go to the client folder and type `npm start`. This starts the the front-end server on port 3000. This is the one that should be open in the browser.
