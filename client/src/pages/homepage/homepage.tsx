                                SeatEat is an app that provides estimation of how busy are KTHâ€™s different 
                                chapter halls. SeatEat looks at the courses and programmes of the students at the different chapter halls through the KTH API. 
                                The estimation is based on how many students have a scheduled activity, as well as popular hours (like lunch).
